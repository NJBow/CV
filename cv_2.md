#### Profile
---
*Knowledge Hungry* :

My main driving force, a thirst for a pure understanding of all situations I face.

Throughout my experiences at Makers Academy, University and it's multiple societies/teams this has proved a valuable asset, that provides for both myself and those surrounding the projects.

*Leadership and teamwork*

Applying both to a team aspect and my own growth, I have built the ability to lead where is required but still remain at a level which my peers and colleagues may approach and debate what happens next.

Vital when organising events at university, and reaching a Minimum Viable Product during my software development projects.

*Analytical Approach*

An ability that has flourished through work related and cultural experiences. my first real instinct to visually analyse came from study of individual Giraffes on a conservancy, this flourished in university and throughout my coding experience and has been invaluable towards Test Driven Development and bug fixing.
