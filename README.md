*Knowledge hungry* :

My main driving force, a thirst for a pure understanding of all situations I face.

This feature has matured throughout my university via the need to know more on the topics I studied. However, I found that my interest in coding and software development has developed far more than my previous academics and thus commands my passion for information.

Throughout my experiences at Makers Academy, University and it's multiple soceities/teams, this has proved a valuable asset that provides for both myself and those surrounding the projects I take part in.

*Leadership and teamwork*

Applying both to a team setting and my own growth, I have built the ability to lead where is required but still remain at a level which my peers and colleagues may approach and debate what happens next.

Vital when organising events at university, and reaching a Minimum Viable Product during my software development projects. 

A specific example would be the AudioDash product. In a team of 5 we were given a 2 week period to create an MVP of our chosen product.
By the beginning of the second week, we had nothing aside from 14 lines of code on a single file, due to lack of direction. I brought the team together by undertaking regular stand-ups, mob reviews and intense pair-programming, leading to us producing an MVP product with additional bonus features.

*Analytical approach*

An ability that has flourished through work related and cultural experiences. My first real instinct to visually analyse came from study of individual giraffes on a conservancy, this flourished in university and throughout my coding experience and has been invaluable towards project development and bug fixing.
