Growing up in South Africa and Kenya gave me a surreal start to life. Nearly completely hidden from the World and it's huge technological advances.

Though on my sixth Birthday, a Nintendo Gameboy Colour Yellow dropped into my world and flourished my enthusiasm to what happened behind each Mario Jump, Every Attack in Pokemon and how on Earth can I make my own?!

FastForward 5 years, I had begun looking into open source code and trying to understand what was happening, though was intimidated at a young age by how incredibly complex it looked.

FastForward 4 more years, due to the enclosed life in Africa, I was lead down a path to be a Surgeon. Thought to be safe and bound to be successful I followed the crowd.

During university however, I became friends with a computer science student who showed me how he created a small app that worked as an alarm clock and begins brewing his coffee (genius). I was astounded, drooled at how badly I wanted to be able to do that myself.

Slowly, in the hours I could spare, I took up learning Ruby language, from the first day I was enticed and found myself looking forward to my coding evenings, far more than my own degree.

Towards the end of my degree, I realised that my passion lay in the field of Software development, whether that be Financial, gaming or pure technology based. All I wanted was to enter the industry and start build my ability. Thus Makers Academy Appeared.

In the Makers interview, I found myself trying to contain my excitement. When I made a mistake during the pair program or didn't do a very efficient method, and was corrected. I relished information and the new shortcuts and paths towards a uniquely fast and smart code to solve a problem.

Graduating Makers has filled me with so much joy and a hunger to improve and to prove myself in code and the larger software community.


## Abilities

#### Knowledge hungry

My main driving force is the thirst for a pure and clear understanding of all I work and interact with. Throughout my university experience, I gained the core learning from my degree but a more expansive understanding of nearly all topics surrounding the cores.

This applies to the Makers experience too, where my ability to truly interpret what happens behind the most basic of methods, allowed me to provide for both the teams and myself, a more clear and concise way of troubleshooting and to reach an MVP at an accelerated pace.

#### leadership and team work

Throughout my time at university, I had been placed in groups where either Leadership lacked or a strong central team binder was needed in order to tackle the tasks, such as AudioDash built during my time at Makers Academy. The AudioDash Project was given a fortnight to reach MVP. By the end of the first week, we had a single file with 14 lines of code, we needed to bring all we had to the table. This set us on course to not only complete our MVP but have additional bonus features we thought would never see the light.

#### Analytical Approach

Strangely, this ability came about from when I was working as an assistant at a Wildlife conservancy spotting and identifying Giraffes by their coat patterns, this led to me being able to pinpoint and pick details in text and other areas that vastely improved my learning and working experience.

Specifically in coding, especially through a TDD approach requires that ability to find the source of the error or unintended behaviour. By being able to dig through a sea of red error lines, and find the true source of issue gives me huge confidence in my own ability to code cleanly and efficiently.

## Experiences

**Olpejeta Wild Life Conservancy** (September to November 2012)    
*Junior Zoologists Assistant*
I was required to keep track of Giraffe numbers and collect samples from individuals. Strangley enough this was truly where my analytical ability emerged where by I was able to register the gender and individual giraffes from far distances through uniques patterns and markings. Not to mention spotting them in think savana bush.  

## Interests

I adore Paddle Boarding, Kayaking, Sailing and Swimming (Parents think I was meant to be born a fish!) I love Cooking, Music and Gaming with others and sharing great experiences!
